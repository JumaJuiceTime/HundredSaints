# Barbarian

Reckless Attack: dr10 to attack, d6 damage. You must be close 
to your target. 1–2 on d6 chance the enemy gets a free attack.


Begins with 2d6 × 10s and d2 Omens. 

hp: Toughness + d10

#### Earliest Memories (D6)
1. A burnt-black building in Sarkash. Your home?
2. A derelict rotting ship rolling endlessly across a grey sea.
3. A brothel in Schleswig. Quite a friendly environment.
4. Sleeping with dogs in the corner of an inn, waiting for 
5. Following an army in eastern Wästland.
6. Suckling a wolf in the wild of Bergen Chrypt.

## Abilities
Built like a bull, roll 3d6+2 for Strength. 
Not a Bright Spark, roll 3d6-1 for Agility and Presence. 
Normal agility tests are DR14 instead of DR12, excluding defence. 
Illiterate;you are incapable of understanding scrolls. If you begin with one then reroll, eat it or use it as toilet paper.

| D6 | You also begin with one of the following |
|---|---|
| 1. | Death Mask: Strikes primitive fear into lesser creatures like goblins, gnoums, and children. While worn, they check Morale every round. |
| 2. | The Festering Scimitar: A stinking sword you pulled from a military shit-ditch. D6 damage. DR 10 attack and defence while you wield it. 1 in 6 chance a wounded enemy is poisoned, dying in 10 minutes. |
| 3. | Wizard Teeth: Four weird teeth rattle within a blackened pouch. Before battle roll a D6 for each one. For every 6 one of your attacks deals maximum damage. |
| 4. | Old Sigurd’s Sling: Sigurd was the strongest man whose throat you ever slit. Woven from his long grey hair, this sling has never failed you. 2D4 damage, requires fist sized rocks which, perhaps regrettably, are everywhere. |
| 5. | Ancient Gore Hound: Asthmatic, deluded and on its last legs, this wizened creature still has a superb nose and can sniffle up treasure in the most disgusting debris. Attacks with DR10 (bite D6). Defends with DR12, 10 HP. Becomes frenzied around goblins and berserkers. |
| 6. | The Shoe of Death’s Horse: It looks normal but since finding it in an obscure crypt you are convinced this sho came from the horse of Death himself. In your hands it hits with DR10, D4 damage. 1 in 6 chance the shoe smashes the skull, instantly killing small-to-medium sized creatures. The shoe returns to your hand like a boomerang. |
