| D6 | You also begin with one of the following |
|---|---|
| 1. | Master of Fate: What use are maps when the substance of causality itself is open to you? You know the right way with a DR8 Presnece test. |
| 2. | Book of Boiling Blood: You may open and read from this book once a day. Your enemy must make a DR12 test to prevent this. If they fail D2 Berserker-slayers (see page 59) appear from the depths of a forgotten dimension of blood. Roll a D6, On a 1-4 these creatures fight alongside you. On a 5-6 they turn on you, attempting to kill you and destroy the book. After the battle they return to their imprisonment. |
| 3. | Speaker of Truths: Twice per day use your wisdom, knowledge, advice and inner calm to bring clarity to a creature of your choice. The DR of the next test they undertake is lowered by 4. |
| 4. | Initiate of the Invisible College: Once per day you may summon D3 scrolls, whose power can be used only once. Roll a D4, on a 1-2 the scrolls are sacred, on a 3-4, unclean. If the scrolls are not used before sunrise they turn to ash. |
| 5. | Bard of the Undying: You learnt you melodies in the Otherworld. The music of your Harp gives +D4 on reaction rolls. |
| 6. | Hawk as Weapon: Your crafty almost-intelligent hawk is loyal only to you. Even without shared language, you understand its cries as it keeps watch, scouts and swoops to attack foes. Attacks/defence DR10 (claws/bite D4) HP8. |
